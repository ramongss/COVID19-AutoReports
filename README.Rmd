## Dataset

The dataset is provided by [Brasil.IO](https://brasil.io) which retrieves the daily information about COVID-19 cases from all 27 Brazilian State Health Offices, assembles and makes them publicly available. The data is daily updated and reported on the [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/brasil_io).

Use the name of the table to the function `download_brasilio_table`, as `caso`, `caso_full`, `obito_cartorio`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
download_brasilio_table <- function(dataset = "covid19", table_name){
  url <- sprintf(
    "https://data.brasil.io/dataset/%s/%s.csv.gz", dataset, table_name
  )
  tmp <- tempfile()
  download.file(url, tmp)
  response <- read.csv(gzfile(tmp), encoding = "UTF-8")
  unlink(tmp)
  return(response)
}

```


## COVID-19 Confirmed cases

Currently, Brazil has a total of **`r format(sum(data_br$new_confirmed), nsmall=1, big.mark=",")`** confirmed cases at **`r format.Date(max(data_br$date), "%d %b, %Y")`**. The daily maximum incidence was **`r format(max(data_br$new_confirmed), nsmall=1, big.mark=",")`** confirmed cases at **`r format.Date(data_br[which(data_br$new_confirmed == max(data_br$new_confirmed)), 'date'], "%d %b, %Y")`**. Here follows the Figure showing the confirmed case incidence as the bars, and the line as the moving average of the last 7 days.

Currently, Brazil has a total of **`r format(sum(data_br$new_deaths), nsmall=1, big.mark=",")`** deaths at **`r format.Date(max(data_br$date), "%d %b, %Y")`**. The daily maximum deaths incidence was **`r format(max(data_br$new_deaths), nsmall=1, big.mark=",")`** deaths at **`r format.Date(data_br[which(data_br$new_deaths == max(data_br$new_deaths)), 'date'], "%d %b, %Y")`**.
